# anaglyphCanvas
Create your own anaglyphs (red/blue 3D pictures).

This code was written to accompany the book my wife wrote "Real Science Experiments: 40 Exciting STEAM Activities for Kids". [Check out the link on the blog post at Sheekgeek.org](https://sheekgeek.org/2020/adamsheekgeek/make-3d-pictures-with-this-free-web-app) where we host this page as well. 

In the book she describes how you can make your own red/blue glasses from scratch. Of course you can use purchased glasses as well. 

This app allows you to vary the distance objects appear when you draw them to give you the full 3D effect. Enjoy!
